\begin{abstract} 
Explain what this is all about, and the main contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Applied Wild Bootstrap to Lancaster test statistic
\item Main theoretical challenge was to show that the conditions required to apply WB are satisfied by Lancaster
\item This was done in a novel way - rather than using the Hoeffding decomposition, we come up with a new method which is simpler, (but requires an extra condition on the timeseries?)
\item We also show that the power of the Lancaster test described in Arthur's original paper can be improved - we show that they used conservative p-values
\end{itemize}
\end{abstract} 

\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe three variable interaction. It is particularly useful for cases in which any pairwise interaction is weak, but that the three variables interact strongly together.
\item Test consists of two parts - calculating the test statistic, and bootstrapping the statistic to sample from the null in order to calculate the p-value threshold.
\item When using time series, the difficult part is the bootstrapping because shuffling the indices breaks the temporal dependence structure.
\item In [Leucht], they give a method for bootstrapping a certain class of statistics.
\item The main contributions of this paper are the folllowing:
\begin{itemize}
\item To show that the Lancaster test statistic is such a statistic
\item This is done using a new style of technique which in particular gives a significantly simpler proof that HSIC is also such a statistic (and thus simplifies the proofs used in [HSIC+time series])
\item To show that the multiple testing corrections used in [Lancaster] are too conservative, and therefore that we can improve test power by using a more relaxed correction.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


This work combines the works of [HSIC + time series] and [Lancaster interaction] to give a non-parametric test for three variable interactions in which the samples are drawn from random processes.

\section{Background} 

In this section we briefly introduce the theory and definitions required to understand the statement and proof of our main result.

\subsection{Kernel Mean Embedding (and HSIC?)}

Given an integrally strictly positive definite kernel $k$ on a set $\mathcal{Z}$, the mapping induced by $k$ from $\mathcal{M(Z)}$, the set of signed measures on $\mathcal{Z}$, to the RKHS $\mathcal{H}_k$ of $k$ via $m \mapsto \int k(x,\cdot)dm(x)$ is injective. Given a finite sample $z_1,\ldots,z_n$ drawn from a probability distribution $\mathbb{P}_z$, the mean embedding $\mu_{\mathbb{P}_z}$ can be estimated as $\hat\mu_{\mathbb{P}_z} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}k(z_i,\cdot)$. This idea is exploited in the construction of certain statistical tests including two sample independence testing (HSIC) - in this case, we wish to understand whether $\mathbb{P}_{XY}$ factorises as $\mathbb{P}_{X}\mathbb{P}_{Y}$ based on finite samples $(X_i,Y_i)$ drawn from $\mathbb{P}_{XY}$. We can consider distance between the empirical embeddings of the two measures via $\| \hat\mu_{\mathbb{P}_{XY}}  - \hat\mu_{\mathbb{P}_{X}\mathbb{P}_{Y}}\|^2$. We can then bootstrap this statistic to generate samples of it under the null hypothesis that $\mathbb{P}_{XY} = \mathbb{P}_{X}\mathbb{P}_{Y}$ to calculate a threshold distance over which we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the distribution does not factorise

\subsection{Lancaster}

The above ideas of injectively embedding measures into a Hilbert space can be extended from the two variable case to consider properties of three or more variables. The Lancaster statistic on the triple of variables $(X,Y,Z)$ is defined as the signed measure $\Delta_LP = \mathbb{P}_{XYZ} - \mathbb{P}_{XY}\mathbb{P}_{Z} - \mathbb{P}_{XZ}\mathbb{P}_{Y} - \mathbb{P}_{X}\mathbb{P}_{YZ} + 2\mathbb{P}_{X}\mathbb{P}_{Y}\mathbb{P}_{Z}$. It can be shown that if any variable is independent of the other two, then $\Delta_LP = 0$. That is,

\[(X,Y) \independent Z \enspace \lor \enspace (X,Z) \independent Y \enspace \lor \enspace X \independent (Y,Z) \Rightarrow \Delta_LP=0 \]

Given a finite sample $(X_i,Y_i,Z_i)_{i=1}^n$, the mean embedding of the Lancaster interaction can be empirically estimated as $\Delta_L\hat{P} = \hat{\mu}_{\mathbb{P}_{XYZ}} - \hat{\mu}_{\mathbb{P}_{XY}\mathbb{P}_{Z}} - \hat{\mu}_{\mathbb{P}_{XZ}\mathbb{P}_{Y}} - \hat{\mu}_{\mathbb{P}_{X}\mathbb{P}_{YZ}} + 2\hat{\mu}_{\mathbb{P}_{X}\mathbb{P}_{Y}\mathbb{P}_{Z}}$. The squared norm of this quantity will be the test statistic of concern for us.

Given kernels $k,l$ and $m$ on $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}$ and $\mathcal{Z}$ respectively, the kernel $k\otimes l \otimes m$ defines a kernel on $\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{Z}$. Letting $K, L$ and $M$ denote the gram matrices, where for example $K_{ij} = k(X_i,X_j)$, we can write

$\|\Delta_L\hat{P}\|_{k\otimes l \otimes m}^2 = \frac{1}{n^2}\left(\tilde{K}\circ\tilde{L}\circ\tilde{M}\right)_{++}$

\subsection{Time series}
In this paper we are extending the existing Lancaster test from the \emph{iid} case to a case in which our observations are drawn from a random process. There are various formalisations of memory or 'mixing' of a random process; of relevance to this paper are the following two:

\subsubsection{$\tau$-mixing}
\begin{definition}
A process $(X_t)_{t}$ is \emph{$\tau$-mixing} if $\tau(r) \longrightarrow 0$ as $r\longrightarrow \infty$, where

\[\tau(r) = \sup_{l\in \mathbb{N}} \frac{1}{l} \sup_{r\leq i_1 \leq \ldots \leq i_l} \tau(\mathcal{F}_0,(X_{i_1}, \ldots, X_{i_l})) \longrightarrow 0\]

where

\[ \tau(\mathcal{M},X) = \mathbb{E} (\sup_{g \in \Lambda} | \int g(t) \mathbb{P}_{X|\mathcal{M}}(dt) -  \int g(t) \mathbb{P}_{X}(dt) |)\]

\end{definition}

\subsubsection{$\beta$-mixing}


\begin{definition}
A process $(X_t)_{t}$ is \emph{$\beta$-mixing} (also known as \emph{absolutely regular}) if $\beta(m) \longrightarrow 0$ as $m\longrightarrow \infty$, where

\[ \beta(m) = \frac{1}{2} \sup_n \sup \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J | \mathbb{P}(A_i \cap B_j) - \mathbb{P}(A_i)\mathbb{P}(B_j)| \]

where the second supremum is taken  over all finite partitions $\{A_1,\ldots, A_I \}$ and  $\{B_1,\ldots, B_J\}$ of the sample space such that $A_i \in \mathcal{A}_1^n$ and $B_j \in \mathcal{A}_{n+m}^\infty$ and $\mathcal{A}_b^c = \sigma(X_b,X_{b+1},\ldots,X_{c})$
\end{definition}

The concept of $\beta$-mixing will be invoked when applying a central limit theorem in the next section. We will also need the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:beta}
Suppose that the process $(X_t,Y_t,Z_t)_t$ is $\beta$-mixing. Then any `sub-process' is also $\beta$-mixing (for example $(X_t,Y_t)_t$ or $(X_t)_t$)
\end{lemma}

\subsection{V-statistics}
A V-statistic of a k-argument, symmetric function $f$ given $iid$ observations $\mathcal{S}_n = \{S_1,\ldots,S_n\}$ where each $S_i \sim \mathbb{P}$ is written

\[ V(f,\mathcal{S}) =  \frac{1}{n^k} \mathlarger{\sum}_{1\leq i_1,\ldots, i_k \leq n} f(S_{i_1},\ldots,S_{i_k})\]

In this case, $V(f,\mathcal{S})$ is a biased (but asymptotically unbiased) estimator of $\mathbb{E}_{S_{i_1},\ldots S_{i_k} \sim \mathbb{P}}[f(S_{i_1},\ldots,S_{i_k})]$

In this paper we are only concerned with V-statistics for which $k=2$. We call $nV(f,\mathcal{S})$ \emph{normalised}. We call $f$ the \emph{core} of $V$ and we say that $f$ is \emph{degenerate} if, for any $s_1$, $\mathbb{E}_{S_2 \sim \mathbb{P}}[f(s_1,S_2)] = 0$ in which case we say that $V$ is a \emph{degenerate V-statistic} 

Of relevance to us is the fact that many kernel test statistics can be viewed as normalised V-statistics which, under the null hypothesis, are degenerate. If moreover the test statistics diverge under the alternative hypothesis, the test would be consistent. Our main result is to prove that the Lancaster statistic is asymptotically a degenerate V-statistic.

\subsection{Wild Bootstrap}



\subsection{Hilbert spaced random variable CLT}

Should we actually state the theorem here? We should include the proof that our situation satisfies the conditions of the theorem regardless though, but maybe in the supplementary section.


\begin{itemize}
\item Kernel mean embedding
\item Lancaster
\item Time series
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tau$-mixing
\item $\beta$-mixing
\item Lemma that sub-processes of $\beta$-mixing processes are $\beta$-mixing
\end{itemize}
\item V-statistics
\item Hilbert space valued random variable central limit theorem
\end{itemize} 

\section{Lancaster Interaction for Random Processes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Statement of Wild Bootstrap theorem (maybe in background though?)
\item Proof that Lancaster satisfies WB theorem hypothesis
\item ...
\item Multiple testing correction (maybe in next section though?)
\end{itemize}

\section{p-values for Lancaster test}
\begin{itemize}
\item In [Lancaster], they use the Holm-Bonferroni correction. Show here that this isn't actually necessary - that the 'naive' correction works and is therefore more powerful as we use $[\alpha,\alpha,\alpha]$ as the thresholds rather than $[\alpha/3,\alpha/2,\alpha]$ or whatever.	
\end{itemize}


\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Artificial data}
\subsection{Real data}
Maybe check this out for some data? \url{https://stat.duke.edu/~mw/ts_data_sets.html}

\section{Proofs}
Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma:beta}:
\begin{claimproof} Let us consider $(X_t,Y_t)_t$.
Let us call $\beta_{XYZ}(m)$ the coefficients for the process $(X_t,Y_t,Z_t)_t$, and $\beta_{XY}(m)$ the coefficients for the process $(X_t,Y_t)_t$. 

Observe that for $A \in \sigma((X_b,Y_b),\ldots, (X_c,Y_c))$, it is the case that $A \times \mathcal{Z} \in \sigma((X_b,Y_b,Z_b),\ldots, (X_c,Y_c,Z_c))$ and $\mathbb{P}_{XY}(A) = \mathbb{P}_{XYZ}(A\times \mathcal{Z})$.

Thus

\begin{align*}
\beta_{XY}(m) &= \frac{1}{2} \sup_n \sup_{ \{A_i^{XY} \}, \{B_j^{XY} \} } \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J | \mathbb{P}_{XY}(A_i^{XY} \cap B_j^{XY}) - \mathbb{P}_{XYZ}(A_i^{XY})\mathbb{P}_{XYZ}(B_j^{XY})| \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \sup_n \sup_{ \{A_i^{XY} \}, \{B_j^{XY} \} } \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J | \mathbb{P}_{XYZ}((A_i^{XY}\times \mathcal{Z}) \cap (B_j^{XY} \times \mathcal{Z})) \\& \quad \quad\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad \quad- \mathbb{P}_{XYZ}(A_i^{XY}\times \mathcal{Z})\mathbb{P}_{XYZ}(B_j^{XY} \times \mathcal{Z})| \\
& \leq \frac{1}{2} \sup_n \sup_{ \{A_i^{XYZ} \}, \{B_j^{XYZ} \} } \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J | \mathbb{P}_{XYZ}(A_i^{XYZ} \cap B_j^{XYZ}) - \mathbb{P}_{XYZ}(A_i^{XYZ})\mathbb{P}_{XYZ}(B_j^{XYZ})| \\
& = \beta_{XYZ}(m)
\end{align*}

Thus we have shown that  $\beta_{XYZ}(m) \longrightarrow 0 \implies \beta_{XY}(m) \longrightarrow 0$. That is, if  $(X_t,Y_t,Z_t)_t$ is $\beta$-mixing then so is  $(X_t,Y_t)_t$ 

A similar argument holds for any other sub-process.
\end{claimproof}
